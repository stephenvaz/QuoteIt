24,"Without a grounding in statistics, a Data Scientist is a Data Lab Assistant.",Martyn Jones,Data Science
25,"Having skills in statistics, math, and programming is certainly necessary to be a great analytic professional, but they are not sufficient to make a person a great analytic professional.",Bill Franks,Data Science
26,Talented data scientists leverage data that everybody sees; visionary data scientists leverage data that nobody sees.,Vincent Granville,Data Science
27,"What makes a good scientist great is creativity with data, skepticism and good communication skills. Getting all of that together in the same person is difficult―because traditionally, different people follow different paths in their careers―some are more technical, others are more creative and communicative. A data scientist has to have both.",Monica Rogati,Data Science
28,"Good data science is exactly the same [as] good science…. Good data science will never be measured by the terabytes in your Cassandra database, the number of EC2 nodes your jobs is using, or the volume of mappers you can send through a Hadoop instance. Having a lot of data does not license you to have a lot to say about it.",Drew Conway,Data Science
29,"Critical thinking skills…really [set] apart the hackers from the true scientists, for me…. You must must MUST be able to question every step of your process and every number that you come up with.",Jake Porway,Data Science
30,"How do we start to regulate the mathematical models that run more and more of our lives? I would suggest that the process begin with the modelers themselves. Like doctors, data scientists should pledge a Hippocratic Oath, one that focuses on the possible misuses and misinterpretations of their models.",Cathy O’Neil,Data Science
31,"With too little data, you won't be able to make any conclusions that you trust. With loads of data you will find relationships that aren't real… Big data isn't about bits, it's about talent.",Douglas Merrill,Data Science
32,"Data analysts who don't organize their transformation pipelines often end up not being able to repeat their analyses, so the advice I would give to myself is the same advice often given to traditional scientists: make your experiments repeatable!",Mike Driscoll,Data Science
33,"Great data scientists never assume they know something without in-depth analysis, they think in hypotheses which need to be either rejected or proved, and they ask a lot of questions, even if they are 99.9% sure they know the answer.",KarolisUrbonas,Data Science
34,"For me, data science is a mix of three things: quantitative analysis (for the rigor necessary to understand your data), programming (so that you can process your data and act on your insights), and storytelling (to help others understand what the data means).",Edwin Chen,Data Science
35,The difference between a great [data scientist] and a good one is like the difference between lightning and a lightning bug.,"Thomas C. Redman, Ph.D.",Data Science
36,"The numbers have no way of speaking for themselves. We speak for them. We imbue them with meaning…. Data-driven predictions can succeed―and they can fail. It is when we deny our role in the process that the odds of failure rise. Before we demand more of our data, we need to demand more of ourselves.",Nate Silver,Data Science
37,"One of the big challenges of being a data scientist that people might not usually think about – is that the results or the insights you come up with have to make sense and be convincing. The more intelligible you can make them, the more likely it is that your recommendations will be put into effect.",Victor Hu,Data Science
38,"A data scientist must possess the knack of being able to identify business value from mathematical models.' But that vital business value can only materialize if the data scientist also networks with other departments, understands their objectives, is familiar with their data and processes – and can spot the analysis options they provide.",Alexander Linden,Data Science
39,"People like simple explanations for complex phenomena. If you work as a data scientist, or if you are planning to become/hire one, you've probably seen storytelling listed as one of the key skills that data scientists should have. Unlike real' scientists that work in academia and have to explain their results mostly to peers who can handle technical complexities, data scientists in industry have to deal with non-technical stakeholders who want to understand how the models work. However, these stakeholders rarely have the time or patience to understand how things truly work. What they want is a simple hand-wavy explanation to make them feel as if they understand the matter―they want a story, not a technical report.",YanirSeroussi,Data Science
40,"You need to be able to take a dataset and discover and communicate what's interesting about it for your users. To turn this into a product requires understanding how to turn one-off analysis into something reliable enough to run day after day, even as the data evolves and grows, and as different users experience different aspects of it.",Amy Heineike,Data Science
41,"We should expect a Big Data 2.0' phase to follow Big Data 1.0'. Once firms have become capable of processing massive data in a flexible fashion, they should begin asking: What can I do that I couldn't do before, or do better than I could do before?' This is likely to be the golden era of data science.",Foster Provost,Data Science
42,"As the field grows, keep an open mind and evolve with it. Work hard, think outside the box, and learn as much as you can about the technical side of being a data scientist. Be responsible with the data and realize the potential the data can have to solving problems. Always ask yourself how the data can be used to positively impact the lives around you, and use that to guide your design and development.",ShanjiXiong,Data Science
1,"By definition all scientists are data scientists. In my opinion, they are half hacker, half analyst, they use data to build products and find insights. It's Columbus meet Columbo―starry-eyed explorers and skeptical detectives.",Monica Rogati,Data Science
2,"Possessed' is probably the right word. I often tell people, I don't want to necessarily be a data scientist. You just kind of are a data scientist. You just can't help but look at that data set and go, I feel like I need to look deeper. I feel like that's not the right fit.'",Jennifer Shin,Data Science
3,"I think of data science as more like a practice than a job. Think of the scientific method, where you have to have a problem statement, generate a hypothesis, collect data, analyze data and then communicate the results and take action…. If you just use the scientific method as a way to approach data-intensive projects, I think you're more apt to be successful with your outcome.",Bob Hayes,Data Science
4,"As a data scientist, I can predict what is likely to happen, but I cannot explain why it is going to happen. I can predict when someone is likely to attrite, or respond to a promotion, or commit fraud, or pick the pink button over the blue button, but I cannot tell you why that's going to happen. And I believe that the inability to explain why something is going to happen is why I struggle to call data science' a science.",Bill Schmarzo,Data Science
5,"Data scientists are kind of like the new Renaissance folks, because data science is inherently multidisciplinary.",John Foreman,Data Science
6,Data Scientist (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.,Josh Wills,Data Science
7,"As data scientists, our job is to extract signal from noise.",Daniel Tunkelang,Data Science
8,"The job of the data scientist is to ask the right questions. If I ask a question like how many clicks did this link get?' which is something we look at all the time, that's not a data science question. It's an analytics question. If I ask a question like, based on the previous history of links on this publisher's site, can I predict how many people from France will read this in the next three hours?' that's more of a data science question.",Hilary Mason,Data Science
9,"A data scientist does model-driven analyses of our data; analyzes to improve our planning, increase our productivity, and develop our deeper levels of subject matter expertise. A data scientist works at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels, sharing insights with the business.",Chris Pehura,Data Science
10,"[Data scientists are] able to think of ways to use data to solve problems that otherwise would have been unsolved, or solved using only intuition.",Peter Skomoroch,Data Science
11,"What sort of personality makes for an effective data scientist? Definitely curiosity…. The biggest question in data science is Why?' Why is this happening? If you notice that there's a pattern, ask, Why? Is there something wrong with the data or is this an actual pattern going on? Can we conclude anything from this pattern? A natural curiosity will definitely give you a good foundation.",Carla Gentry,Data Science
12,"There is a saying, A jack of all trades and a master of none.' When it comes to being a data scientist you need to be a bit like this, but perhaps a better saying would be, A jack of all trades and a master of some.'",Brendan Tierney,Data Science
13,"My number one piece of advice always is to follow your passions first. Know what you are good at and what you care about, and pursue that…. As a successful data scientist, your day can begin and end with you counting your blessings that you are living your dream by solving real-world problems with data.",Dr. Kirk Borne,Data Science
16,"I do not know how you teach someone to love to learn, but being self-motivated is integral to this field. Once you have the core concepts, to be able to be really excited about, and continue to seek out, new information is something that I look for, for example, when we are recruiting people.",Vik Paruchuri,Data Science
17,"You can best learn data mining and data science by doing, so start analyzing data as soon as you can! However, don't forget to learn the theory, since you need a good statistical and machine learning foundation to understand what you are doing and to find real nuggets of value in the noise of big data.","Shelly D. Farnham, Ph.D.",Data Science
18,Learning how to do data science is like learning to ski. You have to do it.,Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro,Data Science
19,"Data science's learning curve is formidable. To a great degree, you will need a degree, or something substantially like it, to prove you're committed to this career….",Claudia Perlich,Data Science
21,There is no bottleneck for data scientists… The bottleneck is very often for companies who don't have a culture of working with data to actually cut down the process into the right steps.,James Kobielus,Data Science
22,"Once you have a certain amount of math/stats and hacking skills, it is much better to acquire a grounding in one or more subjects than in adding yet another programming language to your hacking skills, or yet another machine learning algorithm to your math/stats portfolio…. Clients will rather work with some data scientist A who understands their specific field than with another data scientist B who first needs to learn the basics―even if B is better in math/stats/hacking.",Devavrat Shah,Data Science
44,"The coming era of Artificial Intelligence will not be the era of war, but be the era of deep compassion, non-violence, and love.",Amit Ray,AI/ML
45,"Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. The ultimate search engine that would understand everything on the web. It would understand exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. We're nowhere near doing that now. However, we can get incrementally closer to that, and that is basically what we work on.",Larry Page,AI/ML
46,"Cyber hygiene, patching vulnerabilities, security by design, threat hunting, and machine learning-based artificial intelligence are mandatory prerequisites for cyber defense against the next generation threat landscape.",James Scott,AI/ML
47,You have to talk about The Terminator' if you're talking about artificial intelligence. I actually think that that's way off. I don't think that an artificially intelligent system that has superhuman intelligence will be violent. I do think that it will disrupt our culture.,Gray Scott,AI/ML

55,Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make. ,Nick Bostrom,AI/ML
56,"Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks.",Stephen Hawking,AI/ML
57,"The pace of progress in artificial intelligence (I'm not referring to narrow AI) is incredibly fast. Unless you have direct exposure to groups like Deepmind, you have no idea how fast—it is growing at a pace close to exponential. The risk of something seriously dangerous happening is in the five-year time frame. 10 years at most.",Elon Musk,AI/ML
58,"It seems probable that once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers… They would be able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits. At some stage, therefore, we should have to expect the machines to take control.",Alan Turing,AI/ML
59,"If people trust artificial intelligence (AI) to drive a car, people will most likely trust AI to do your job. ",Dave Waters,AI/ML

62,"Anything that could give rise to smarter-than-human intelligence—in the form of Artificial Intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, or neuroscience-based human intelligence enhancement – wins hands down beyond contest as doing the most to change the world. Nothing else is even in the same league.",Eliezer Yudkowsky,AI/ML

68,A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human.,Alan Turing,AI/ML
70,"I'm more frightened than interested by artificial intelligence – in fact, perhaps fright and interest are not far away from one another. Things can become real in your mind, you can be tricked, and you believe things you wouldn't ordinarily. A world run by automatons doesn't seem completely unrealistic anymore. It's a bit chilling.",Gemma Whelan,Analytics

86,"We have seen AI providing conversation and comfort to the lonely; we have also seen AI engaging in racial discrimination. Yet the biggest harm that AI is likely to do to individuals in the short term is job displacement, as the amount of work we can automate with AI is vastly larger than before. As leaders, it is incumbent on all of us to make sure we are building a world in which every individual has an opportunity to thrive.",Andrew Ng,AI/ML
88,"Different verticals need different terminal retention rates for them to have successful businesses. If you're on e-commerce and you're retaining on a monthly active basis, like 20 to 30% of your users, you're going to do very well. If you're on social media, and the first batch of people signing up to your product are not like, 80% retained, you're not going to have a massive social media site.

91,"Have a vision for what you are trying to do. Use data to validate and help you navigate that vision, and map it down into small enough pieces where you can begin to execute in a data-informed way.

92,"Execution is so critical. Sometimes you just need to try something, see what works and move forward.",Meenal Balar,Analytics
93,"When we initially started testing email subject lines, we defined the success criteria as driving an email open. This seemed to be the most straightforward since the Pinner reads the email subject line and the next action is to either open it or don't. What we found, however, was that defining success with metrics that were further downstream (i.e. clicking on the content in the email) was more effective.",John Egan,Analytics
94,"If there's one takeaway it's that it's okay to do small wins. Small wins are good, they will compound. If you're doing it right the end result will be massive.",Kevin Li,Analytics
95,"The most important thing we've done to improve our user onboarding was to define our activation metric and get serious about tracking the inputs to that metric. Agreeing on what a successfully ""activated"" account looked like, and understanding all the individual actions to get there, allowed us to take our new user onboarding to the next level. We formed a cross-functional team dedicated to increasing that metric. The team is able to clearly prioritize ideas and projects since we all agree what success looks like. That activation metric is paying huge dividends to our users and our company.",Andrew Caplan,Analytics
96,There's more objectivity in one customer sharing their passion and love for a product with another than there is in ads or promotion. It allows the company to spend less to achieve lasting growth.,Julie Supan,Analytics

100,"As you gain fresh insight from your data, it opens the door to new questions. As you have new questions, you need to update your instrumentation and analysis. Saying the process is done is saying you understand everything there is to know about your users, product, and channels.",Hiten Shah,Analytics
101,"Analytics software is uniquely leveraged. Most software can optimize existing processes, but analytics (done right) should generate insights that bring to life whole new initiatives. It should change what you do, not just how you do it.",Carly Fiorina,Analytics
102,"If you pick the right metrics for success, you will be able to significantly improve the focus of the whole team and thus improve your business. Developing these metrics should be done first by making hypotheses about your business and validating / invalidating these hypotheses. From there you will have a good base understanding that will allow you to determine what metrics to focus on and how to define success for your business.",Ben Porterfield,Analytics
103,"The goal is to turn data into information, and information into insight.",Eoghan McCabe,Analytics
104,"You want everyone to be able to look at the data and make sense out of it. It should be a value everyone has at your company, especially people interfacing directly with customers. There shouldn't be any silos where engineers translate the data before handing it over to sales or customer service. That wastes precious time.",Stewart Butterfield,Analytics
105,"We've tried to put passion and art and love and creativity ahead of revenue and valuation and buzz and traction, discovering that the latter can often follow the former.",Leo Widrich,Analytics
106,"Of course hard numbers tell an important story; user stats and sales numbers will always be key metrics. But every day, your users are sharing a huge amount of qualitative data, too — and a lot of companies either don't know how or forget to act on it.",Jackson Noel,Analytics
107,"We live in a time where data is all around us, and there's a lot of great advice to show us how to make better use of data. However, I've found that in some cases this can be a huge waste of time, especially early on with your startup. Replace some of your current focus on quantitative data to qualitative data).",Brian Chesky,Analytics
108,"The single most important thing we've done for onboarding is planning past the first session. Let's say you have a SaaS application and know that new users who take actions X, Y, and Z end up being really successful.",Kevin Systrom,Analytics
109,It's tempting to build a linear new user flow that encourages them to take these 3 actions then call it a day. But that's just not how humans evaluate software - most of them will hardly complete one of the three actions in their first session. [...],David Barrett,Analytics
110,"Planning past the first session matches your funnel to your buyer's decision making process. It means aligning your in-product experiences, email campaigns and sales/customer success outreach to reinforce the user's success path.",Mitch Lowe,Analytics
111,"The problem with Silicon Valley is when you build an app you are expected to make the app go viral and reach millions of people. This is the worst way to think about it — it's much better to get 100 people to love you. There was no way we could get 1M people on Airbnb, but we could get 100 people to love us. This is when we decided to do things that wouldn't scale. Getting 100 people to love you is hard — getting people to like you is much easier than getting people to love you.",Lloyd Tabb,Analytics
112,"I learned a lesson from watching other companies who held onto things too long. If you look at the history of companies that have succeeded and the ones that have failed, there's a pretty clear pattern that the ones that have succeeded typically morph every couple of years into something new. And that change is fairly uncomfortable.",Paul Graham,Analytics
113,"[For early-stage startups,] data is never there when you need it most. At best, data can help you make very small, incremental decisions. But if you're a startup, you're focused on big, broad swings — and data has no place in that. You don't have enough users to draw any meaningful conclusions, and even if you did those users aren't necessarily representative of your long term target audience. You've got data, sure. But not enough to make a genuine, data-driven decision, and pretending otherwise is a recipe for disaster.",Jessica Livingston,Analytics
114,Use analytics to make decisions. I always thought you needed a clear answer before you made a decision and the thing that he taught me was [that] you've got to use analytics directionally…and never worry whether they are 100% sure. Just try to get them to point you in the right direction.,Peter Levine,Analytics
115,Your metrics influence each other. You need to monitor how. Don't just measure which clicks generate orders. Back it up and break it down. Follow users from their very first point of contact with you to their behavior on your site and the actual transaction. You have to make the linkage all the way through.,Arjun Sethi,Analytics
116,"Venture capitalists have a unique perspective on business and analytics, because they evaluate from an outside perspective.

118,"Merely measuring something has an uncanny tendency to improve it. If you want to make your user numbers go up, put a big piece of paper on your wall and everyday plot the number of users. You'll be delighted when it goes up and disappointed when it goes down. Pretty soon you'll start noticing what makes the number go up, and you'll start to do more of that. Corollary: be careful what you measure.",Bill Gurley,Analytics
119,Your users are your guidepost. And the way you stay on the right path in the early stages of a startup is to build stuff and talk to users. And nothing else.,Cindy Alvarez,Analytics
120,"For predictive analytics, we need an infrastructure that's much more responsive to human-scale interactivity: What's happening today that may influence what happens tomorrow? A lot of iteration needs to occur on a continual basis for the system to get smart, for the machine to learn — explore the data, visualize it, build a model, ask a question, an answer comes back, bring in other data, and repeat the process. The more real-time and granular we can get, the more responsive, and more competitive, we can be.",Jonathan Hsu,Analytics
121,You must constantly try to disrupt yourself. The most successful companies embrace cannibalization at the core. [...]You need to innovate and be willing to threaten the core of your business in order to survive. Or you'll die!,Charles Babbage,Analytics
122,"I often see teams that maniacally focus on their metrics around customer acquisition and retention. This usually works well for customer acquisition, but not so well for retention. Why? For many products, metrics often describe the customer acquisition goal in enough detail to provide sufficient management guidance. In contrast, the metrics for customer retention do not provide enough color to be a complete management tool. As a result, many young companies overemphasize retention metrics and do not spend enough time going deep enough on the actual user experience. This generally results in a frantic numbers chase that does not end in a great product.",Michael O'Connell,Analytics
123,"Don't obsess over these sub metrics, but obsess over the key metrics that tie into your revenue growth. Everything can be measured, including engineering, PR, product and marketing. If you have your engineering team agree to measure the output of features quarter over quarter, you will get more features built. It's just a fact. You have to measure every functional area. Measure them all and have everyone agree to the same growth goals to support your revenue, and magical things will happen.",Edward Tufte,Analytics
124,"If an Internet company could obsess about only one metric, it should be conversion. No other metric so holistically captures as many critical aspects of a web site – user design, usability, performance, convenience, ad effectiveness, net promoter score, customer satisfaction – all in a single measurement. Yet despite the remarkable power of this metric, it is alarming how few companies today truly understand conversion and how to optimize it. As such, it is time to pound the table again – conversion is by far the most powerful Internet metric of all.",Authors of Made to Stick,Analytics
125,"Thought leaders, especially in the tech world, are focused on the possibilities in front of us and push everyone to get smarter, faster, and stronger.

It is represented by 90% of the data budget invested in Agencies and Consultants driving implementation and re-implementation and hyper-customization of the code. It is represented by the act of creating crazy data thresholds for any initiative to get off the ground. [...]  Data is important. I believe it can help drive your business strategy smartly. But, a data-first strategy, defined as above, is nuts. It will only slow down your progress and allow your competitors to crush you like a bug (even if you are a top player in your market today!).You can have data without information, but you cannot have information without data.",Tom Conrad,Analytics

134,"The key is to let computers do what they are good at, which is trawling these massive data sets for something that is mathematically odd, and that makes it easier for humans to do what they are good at — explain those anomalies.",Monica Rogati,Analytics
135,Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves.,Mark Andreessen,Analytics
136,"""One metric alone doesn't tell you what's happening with your site; as ever Analytics is about taking your data and outside influences (i.e. time of year) and building insights from all of it.",Sean Ellis,Analytics
137,"In a marketing analytics worldview, companies must have an accounting of and insight into all of their marketing programs in all of their channels, including web/browser, mobile apps, TV/video, social, paid media, field, print, outdoor and others. If your organization is still stuck in the web analytics mindset, it is time to reinvent your analytics practice, leveraging all of the available marketing analytics tools to make faster and better decisions and drive your business.",Daniel Wolchonok,Analytics
