1, "By definition all scientists are data scientists. In my opinion, they are half hacker, half analyst, they use data to build products and find insights. It's Columbus meet Columbo―starry-eyed explorers and skeptical detectives.", Monica Rogati, Data Science,
2, "Possessed' is probably the right word. I often tell people, I don't want to necessarily be a data scientist. You just kind of are a data scientist. You just can't help but look at that data set and go, I feel like I need to look deeper. I feel like that's not the right fit.'", Jennifer Shin, Data Science,
3, "I think of data science as more like a practice than a job. Think of the scientific method, where you have to have a problem statement, generate a hypothesis, collect data, analyze data and then communicate the results and take action…. If you just use the scientific method as a way to approach data-intensive projects, I think you're more apt to be successful with your outcome.", Bob Hayes, Data Science,
4, "As a data scientist, I can predict what is likely to happen, but I cannot explain why it is going to happen. I can predict when someone is likely to attrite, or respond to a promotion, or commit fraud, or pick the pink button over the blue button, but I cannot tell you why that's going to happen. And I believe that the inability to explain why something is going to happen is why I struggle to call data science' a science.", Bill Schmarzo, Data Science,
5, "Data scientists are kind of like the new Renaissance folks, because data science is inherently multidisciplinary.", John Foreman, Data Science,
6, "Data Scientist (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.", Josh Wills, Data Science,
7, "As data scientists, our job is to extract signal from noise.", Daniel Tunkelang, Data Science,
8, "The job of the data scientist is to ask the right questions. If I ask a question like how many clicks did this link get?' which is something we look at all the time, that's not a data science question. It's an analytics question. If I ask a question like, based on the previous history of links on this publisher's site, can I predict how many people from France will read this in the next three hours?' that's more of a data science question.", Hilary Mason, Data Science,
9, "A data scientist does model-driven analyses of our data; analyzes to improve our planning, increase our productivity, and develop our deeper levels of subject matter expertise. A data scientist works at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels, sharing insights with the business.", Chris Pehura, Data Science,
10, "[Data scientists are] able to think of ways to use data to solve problems that otherwise would have been unsolved, or solved using only intuition.", Peter Skomoroch, Data Science,
11, "What sort of personality makes for an effective data scientist? Definitely curiosity…. The biggest question in data science is Why?' Why is this happening? If you notice that there's a pattern, ask, Why? Is there something wrong with the data or is this an actual pattern going on? Can we conclude anything from this pattern? A natural curiosity will definitely give you a good foundation.", Carla Gentry, Data Science,
12, "There is a saying, A jack of all trades and a master of none.' When it comes to being a data scientist you need to be a bit like this, but perhaps a better saying would be, A jack of all trades and a master of some.'", Brendan Tierney, Data Science,
13, "My number one piece of advice always is to follow your passions first. Know what you are good at and what you care about, and pursue that…. As a successful data scientist, your day can begin and end with you counting your blessings that you are living your dream by solving real-world problems with data.", Dr. Kirk Borne, Data Science,
16, "I do not know how you teach someone to love to learn, but being self-motivated is integral to this field. Once you have the core concepts, to be able to be really excited about, and continue to seek out, new information is something that I look for, for example, when we are recruiting people.", Vik Paruchuri, Data Science,
17, "You can best learn data mining and data science by doing, so start analyzing data as soon as you can! However, don't forget to learn the theory, since you need a good statistical and machine learning foundation to understand what you are doing and to find real nuggets of value in the noise of big data.", Shelly D. Farnham, Data Science,
18, "Learning how to do data science is like learning to ski. You have to do it.", Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro, Data Science,
19, "Data science's learning curve is formidable. To a great degree, you will need a degree, or something substantially like it, to prove you're committed to this career….", Claudia Perlich, Data Science,
21, "There is no bottleneck for data scientists… The bottleneck is very often for companies who don't have a culture of working with data to actually cut down the process into the right steps.", James Kobielus, Data Science,
22, "Once you have a certain amount of math/stats and hacking skills, it is much better to acquire a grounding in one or more subjects than in adding yet another programming language to your hacking skills, or yet another machine learning algorithm to your math/stats portfolio…. Clients will rather work with some data scientist A who understands their specific field than with another data scientist B who first needs to learn the basics―even if B is better in math/stats/hacking.", Devavrat Shah, Data Science,
