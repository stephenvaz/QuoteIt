            "1) Possessed' is probably the right word. I often tell people, I don't want to necessarily be a data scientist. You just kind of are a data scientist. You just can't help but look at that data set and go, I feel like I need to look deeper. I feel like that's not the right fit.'\n",
            "2) The difference between a great [data scientist] and a good one is like the difference between lightning and a lightning bug.\n",
            "3) Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves.\n",
            "4) Data science's learning curve is formidable. To a great degree, you will need a degree, or something substantially like it, to prove you're committed to this career….\n",
            "5) What makes a good scientist great is creativity with data, skepticism and good communication skills. Getting all of that together in the same person is difficult―because traditionally, different people follow different paths in their careers―some are more technical, others are more creative and communicative. A data scientist has to have both.\n"
